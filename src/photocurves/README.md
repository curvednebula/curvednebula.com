Photo Curves is a photo editing app with focus on color grading. Experiment with your photos using flexible color correction and tuning tools. Create your own filters instead of searching through hundreds of apps with predefined filters, which you can't adjust. With this app you can also enhance, tune or replace colors, create famous cinematic Orange Teal look, adjust white balance, resize photos or save them with different jpeg quality to optimize file size.

## Color Grading Tools

- **Basic controls** - brightness, contrast, shadows, highlights, saturation.

- **Color wheels** - add color to shadows, midtones, or highlights.

- **RGB curves** - control red, green, and blue channels independently.

- **LAB curves** - unlike RGB, LAB color space allows you to manipulate color channels separately from brightness component. This gives you much more creative freedom to play with colors.

- **Hue vs Saturation curve** - make one color more vibrant than others, or leave one or two colors only, making the rest of the picture black and white.

- **Hue vs Hue curve** - replace colors or color ranges with another color(s) by shifting their hue. I.e. you can change the color of the blue sky or green grass, which can completely change the mood of your photo.

- **Hue vs Luma curve** - adjust brightness of selected colors or color ranges. This allows you to brighten or dim parts of your image creating interesting creative effects.

- **Luma vs Saturation curve** - adjust saturation of shades, midtones, or highlights.

- **Luma vs Hue curve** - shift hue of shades, midtones, or highlights.

- **Saturation vs Saturation curve** - boost saturation of unsaturated parts of your picture and decrease over-saturated areas to create evenly saturated HDR like pictures.
