# Photo Curves - Color Grading App

## Overview

Photo Curves is a photo editing app with focus on color grading. Experiment with flexible color grading tools (RGB/CMYK/LAB/HSL Curves, Color Wheels, Layer Masks). Create your own filters/LUTs instead of searching through hundreds of apps with predefined presets. Each preset in Photo Curves is fully adjustable. You can easily create your custom presets too. With this app you can also correct, enhance or replace colors, shift HUE, fix white balance, create 3DLUTs, resize images and more.

## Color Grading Tools

- **Basic controls** - brightness, contrast, shadows, highlights, saturation.

- **Color wheels** - add color to shadows, midtones, or highlights.

- **Layer Masks** - create adjustment layers and draw masks to apply color grading manipulations to a selected area of an image.

- **RGB curves** - control red, green, and blue channels independently.

- **CMYK curves** - control cyan, magenta, yellow, and key channels of CMYK color space.

- **LAB curves** - unlike RGB, LAB color space allows you to manipulate color channels separately from brightness component.

- **Hue vs Saturation curve** - increase or decrease saturation of certain colors.

- **Hue vs Hue curve** - change colors by selective HUE shift.

- **Hue vs Luma curve** - adjust brightness of a color or a HUE range.

- **Luma vs Saturation curve** - adjust saturation of shades, midtones, and highlights.

- **Luma vs Hue curve** - shift HUE of shades, midtones, or highlights.

- **Saturation vs Saturation curve** - boost unsaturated and decrease over-saturated colors to create evenly saturated HDR like images.
